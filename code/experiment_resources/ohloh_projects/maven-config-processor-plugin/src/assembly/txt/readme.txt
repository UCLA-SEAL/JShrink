Config Processor, version ${project.version}
-----------------------------

1. Introduction

The Config Processor applies transformations to configuration files to prepare
them for different environments.
It tries to implement the same ideas implemented by XConf
(http://xconf.sourceforge.net), but does it more easily integrated with Maven
and using standard ways of processing XML (XPath) and includes better
support for properties files processing.

Please, see the maven generated site opening the docs/site/index.html file
in your browser for examples of use with Maven 2 and Ant.

Alternatively, you can execute maven and ant on the example project in
examples/example-project by doing the following steps:

1. cd to examples/example-project
2. execute 'mvn package' and see the processed files in target/processed
4. execute 'mvn clean' to delete the target folder
5. execute 'ant' and see the processed files in target/processed
(they look just like those generated by maven, the configurations are identical)
